          The plane went missing shortly after air traffic control instructed the pilots to switch to ATC in Ho Chi Minh City. The plane never switched but instead, it remained disconnected. At first, it only seemed to be a delay in connecting, but the plane continued to fly without connecting to ATC.  In addition to air traffic control, another way to communicate with a plane is through its transponder. It is mandatory for all planes to keep their transponders on, however shortly after MH370 lost connection with ATC their transponders also turned off. A third way planes can communicate is through the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System which is located in the cockpit and in the main cabin. Both of these went offline as well. <br> <b> Within minutes, 3 methods of contact with the plane were lost. What could have caused this?</b></p>

The only way a plane of this size could lose all communication was if there was a major fire or power failure in the plane. At first, it would seem possible that something like that could happen. However, just minutes before, the pilots were talking to ATC and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. There was no distress signal sent out either. A large fire would have brought down the plane promptly. Yet, satellites were still able to contact the plane. The satellites were able to ping the plane for over 6 hours suggesting the plane remained in the air for a long time.  If there was an accident, these satellite antenna would have also gone offline.
