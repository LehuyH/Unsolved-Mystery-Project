        According to a report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the plane went missing shortly after air
        traffic control instructed the pilots to switch to ATC in Ho Chi Minh City. The plane never switched but
        instead, it remained disconnected. At first, it only seemed to be a delay in connecting, but the plane continued
        to fly without connecting to ATC. In addition to air traffic control, another way to communicate with a plane is
        through its transponder. It is mandatory for all planes to keep their transponders on, however shortly after
        MH370 lost connection with ATC their transponders also turned off. A third way planes can communicate is through
        the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System which is located in the cockpit and in the main
        cabin. Both of these went offline as well. <br> <b> Within minutes, 3 methods of contact with the plane were
          lost. What could have caused this?</b></p>
        <br>

          <div class="col-sm vCenter">
            <p>



              The only way a plane of this size could lose all communication was if there was a major fire or power
              failure in the plane. At first, it would seem possible that something like that could happen. However,
              just minutes before, the pilots were talking to ATC and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. There was no
              distress signal sent out either. A large fire would have brought down the plane promptly.

              Yet, satellites were still able to contact the plane. The satellites were able to ping the plane for over
              6 hours suggesting the plane remained in the air for a long time. If there was an accident, these
              satellite antenna would have also gone offline.

        <p>Another important detail that disproves that the disappearance was an accident was where the plane flew after
          the connection was lost. Not only was the plane still up after connection was lost, but another method of
          tracking, military radar, kept tabs on the plane even though the normal ways of tracking were offline. </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm vCenter">
            <p>



              According to the Safety Investigation Report, the data from the radar shows that the plane took a slight
              right turn then took a large
              left turn almost 180 degrees back towards Malaysia. If there was an accident, turning back to Malaysia to
              land would make sense as that was where the closest land was located. However the plane never attempted to
              land, it continued flying in a straight line until the plane took a slight right at Penang Island. From
              there the plane continued to fly in that direction until the plane went out of military radar range.

              At this point, the only form of communication that was still online was the satellite antenna. The
              satellites made multiple handshakes or pings with the plane. Although the pings don't provide location
              data, analysts were still able to calculate how fast the plane was going based on the time it took for the
              plane to respond. The plane was going at a normal speed of 600MPH away from the satellite based on this
              data, multiple rings were made showing the possible locations of the planes.
              <br><br>
              By now it is clear that someone was in control of the plane, in the event of an accident the plane would
              have likely crashed earlier or landed when it flew over malyasia. The precise turns made also means that
              the likelyhood of the plane running on autopilot is low. Someone was still in manual control of the plane.
