The search effort took place in multiple areas. The inital areas of search were along the South China Sea. The area was expanded to cover the Strait of Malacca after the Malaysian Military revealed more information.

However, days after the disappearance,  more information came out about the flight. The search areas were adjusted again using satellite handshakes.  The new search areas were very remote, sometimes taking days just to reach there.

          <p>Another important detail that disproves that the disappearance was an accident was where the plane flew after the connection was lost. Not only was the plane still up after connection was lost, but another method of tracking, military radar, kept tabs on the plane even though the normal ways of tracking were offline. </p>

                Another important detail that disproves that the disappearance was an accident was where the plane flew after the connection was lost. Not only was the plane still up after connection was lost, but another method of tracking, military radar, kept tabs on the plane even though the normal ways of tracking were offline. <br><br> The data from the radar shows that the plane took a slight right turn then took a large left turn almost 180 degrees back towards Malaysia. If there was an accident, turning back to Malaysia to land would make sense as that was where the closest land was located. However the plane never attempted to land, it continued flying in a straight line until the plane took a slight right at Penang Island. From there the plane continued to fly in that direction until the plane went out of military radar range.

                At this point, the only form of communication that was still online was the satellite antenna. The satellites made multiple handshakes or pings with the plane. Although the pings don't provide location data, analysts were still able to calculate how fast the plane was going based on the time it took for the plane to respond. The plane was going at a normal speed of 600MPH away from the satellite based on this data, multiple rings were made showing the possible locations of the planes.
                <br><br>
                By now it is clear that someone was in control of the plane, in the event of an accident the plane would have likely crashed earlier or landed when it flew over malyasia. The precise turns made also means that the likelyhood of the plane running on autopilot is low. Someone was still in manual control of the plane.
